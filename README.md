This is my grand finale cryptocurrency coin project, which I will strive to stay in control of until [God forbid] I die or something else happens.
I created Bitcoin, yes, in the year 2000.  I released a lot of that work in 2001. I released this information under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto.
I have had mental illnesses and identity disorder since that time. I lost my mind and I gave up work on Bitcoin all at the same time. Truth hurts.
So here it is, best of luck, and please do keep in touch more, as I am probably the loneliest and most unlucky guy in the world, and I could use friends.
Thank you to the cryptocurrency community and every Satoshi who has contributed invaluable information and hard work to make my dreams turn into reality.
Best of Luck and economic greatness to each and every investor in Crypto.
